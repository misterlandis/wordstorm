A word processor for kids.

Thie idea is to create a word processor for students who's literacy skills are just forming, so that their use of the computer as a writing tool can develop along with their use of other writing skills.

The first goal is to make writing as fun as possible so that children can learn to enjoy the writing process and see it as a way of communicating.

The second goal is to scaffold the learning of some of the eccentricities that go along with using a word processor.  Things like finding keys on the keyboard, moving the cursor to insert, using spaces appropriately, and adding new lines will be animated on the screen so that they are easier to notice and the student can more easily develop an understanding of their purpose.
